da76yvu,avg is around 400-600 JOD for each individual
da71cfd,Oh you're that guy...

I honestly hate people like you. Just keep your shit to yourself. You're annoying as fuck. Sorry to be blunt but that's the truth and also the answer to your question. You're just lame, boring, and nosy
da6teza,sex , politics and religion are taboos here 
for some reason people think that opening these taboos will get the people corrupted and we should not be involved in any sex talks since it will destroy our traditions and will defy our religious beliefs and we shouldn't talk about religion unless it was judaism or we will be like those other secular nations with no moral codes and we should not talk about politics because we don't want to sleep anywhere but home and that's pretty much it..
Welcome to jordan! 
da5pgs8,The NSA collected/collects info on people at least two jumps away from persons of interest, from texts to social media, by way of raw data dumps sifted through by specialized programs that can index and flag content; it's not out of the realm of possibility, given our Arab/Muslim backgrounds and location, that what we send, receive, and search is sitting in a database.

Whether that data is shared with local agencies or, I can't say for sure, but I expect it is.

Now do local agencies actively monitor text/call traffic in Jordan? I would be shocked if they didn't. Call tapping for intel purposes goes at least as far back as beginning of the cold war; and given that American agencies can "listen in" on both non-citizens and citizens by way of rubber-stamped classified courts, I don't see why Jordanian intelligence can't do the same here in the land of "civil liberties?". While this isn't pre-war Syria where the government would black bag you in the middle of the night, or day, you're still being watched. Though whether directly or indirectly, and to what degree, I couldn't say.      
da5oln3,But this is small time junk that I doubt they'd bother sharing. Dunno, was just curious about peoples' thoughts. Do they crack down on this stuff big time in Amman (not talking about through reddit, but actual texts/calls, and just through the streets)?
da5nkig,The Jordanian Mukhabarat? Unlikely.

But US agencies cast a wide net through a variety of programs and at least some information sharing between them and intelligence agencies in the ME is very likely.
da5nehg,Do you really think Mukhabarat are on reddit?
da5kxtz,If I can ride it, no problem :D
da5ifsf,OP is a regular poster on r/islam and is known for his racism and misogyny and has made many negative generalizations about Arabs.  
da5i4q4,Can I bring my cow?
da5cszo,Dude, this is not California
da50psm,Oh, man! we were waiting for someone like you for a long time, we'll give you the hashish around our house for free, just bring a Lawnmower with you :D
da4qe4m,Maybe this friend does not appreciate being lectured on her life choices. This is likely the source of her annoyed-ness (is that a word?).
da4q73v,that's not for you to judge.
da4q0hw,My generalisations are not really far off the mark.
da4punn,>other Muslim communities.

Wow you're quick on the draw when it comes to generalization. First generalizing one incident to a whole country and then generalizing another assumption to everyone else.
da4anhn,We were never taught to discuss and argue properly *especially * about religion, so its a skill we don't know exist, instead, we were taught religion with force, and imams yelling it at us.

So when you start discussing religion the firdt thing we go for is the shouting imam method.
da49n5v,I will sell you :) but I'm not near Khalda. I'm in Amsterdam. 
da49esv,Nice try ŸÖŸÉÿßŸÅÿ≠ÿ©.
da44r8d,I think an estimate would be 200 books.  
da437bu,Theres definitely racism in Jordan, racism exists in every country. In Jordan, people are nice and polite to black people and everything but a lot of people definitely look down on them. It is kind of sad because racism is not permitted in Islam and most Jordanians are Muslims. 

In fact, a semi popular term to describe black people is abed which means slave. People say this without flinching. 

With all of that said, I wouldnt say Jordan has a racism problem in particular or anything. Though the whole abed thing always blew my mind. 
da42yok,I thought it was the W124 (E class) that was referred to as batta

Shaba7 refers to W140 (S Class)

Qursh wa nuss was the w210 (E Class), and maybe the W211 
da42aja,I'm Muslim myself and this isn't the case in other Muslim communities.
da425mh,The way you explained your example you were not trying to have a discussion about their religion in a general sort of way. You wanted to discuss how they were intentionally breaking one of the tenants of Islam. Many people around the world might not want to discuss their specific religious failings not just Jordanians. 
da41qcj,Yep, not much to lose though

da87ynp,It's shifted over to Wes Matthews
da87y8z,Shoulda gone with hallejruejah
da87y8f,Big bird
da87y3t,I consider myself a bandwagon warrior fan since they're my secondary team. I can see why it can be annoying. I only started rooting for the Warriors after they beat Denver in the 2013 playoffs and because Steph's my favourite player. I wasn't there for the shitty years but I still wear Warriors gear.
da87y04,Man, I just don't think repeating the same thing over and over again is funny.  I'm probably just old.
da87xem,I believe he can play better.  Which is good news for the Rockets.
da87x5e,I was at the game last night and it's so nice to see Nik get some swagger and confidence in his game. Dude could hit from anywhere last night.

da87x2u,That thumbnail is the best thing I'll see all day 
da87x0k,Feels over reals
da87wwx,Because LeBron is much closer to MJ than he is to Magic. 

His passing is incredibly overrated and his scoring is underrated.

His defence isn't MJ level but it's closer to MJ's than it is to Magic's terrible D.

 - MJ : 30-6-5-2.5-1 on 50/33/84

 - LBJ : 27-7-7-2-1 on 50/34/74

 - Magic : 20-7-11-2-0.5 on 52/30/85

LeBron is closer to MJ than he is to Magic in PTS, AST, BLK, FG%, FT%, 3PFG%

LeBron is closer to Magic than he is to MJ in REB and STL
da87wrw,Covington still wasn't good, but they kept his minutes down, and they won.
da87wkh,Draymond has some kind of crazy ass memory. He remembers plays other teams ran from years before
da87wdn,Then somehow lost it at Marquette and during his first few years in the NBA.
da87w8u,it's the ballhog gloves isn't it 

that's why he's so good 
da87w2y,You don't think it's an issue having your backup SF be a project who hasn't played a minute this season? And that's behind Carroll who's been either hurt or struggling. 
da87vl4,there's also some guy in golden state who's playing pretty well
da87vka,Future shit poster:

You have my permission to overlay KP onto Dirk Nowitzki.
da87vix,I propose a 4th "All Small ball team"

PG: Magic

SG: MJ

SF: Lebron

PF: Bird

C: Draymond Green
da87v50,first you say:

>I think LeBron is a better more complete player than almost anyone >who I ever saw play basketball.

and then you say: 

>I am not that young and watched MJ though his college career

that's what I'm replying to, can't you follow your own point, or are you that young that you get lost in your own sentences??

anyway I'm done here, MJ was better than your boy bronbron your boy isn't even on the same floor when it comes to his airness.




da87uiu,They're getting old tho
da87uhj,Your flair checks out
da87udm,inb4 vivek fires vlade and trades cousins for nik
da87txc,Watch Hakeem as he turns his back to Shaq, he visibly brings the ball up (not to the extent that one could call it a gather), takes two steps, and then one additional 1 foot take off. 

It's not that hard to see. Just notice how many steps Hakeem takes the moment he brings the ball up and you can easily tell he takes 3 steps, but it is not technically a travel in this case. 
da87ttb,A three peat.
da87tcj,Meanwhile I maxed out at 5'8" when I was like 14. Cool.

da88dul,we had a 19 win season less than a decade ago.
da88dp7,LMAO wait the announcer actually says "SAUCE CASTILLOOO" hahahaha
da88dik,I think the team strategy is that if Steph goes over the screen the screeners man needs to help cover the shot. 
da88dcd,Apparently now that they're 10-2 I'm a apparently on the Clippers bandwagon. I chose them back in 2010 when they placed 13th because I didn't want to bandwagon on a big team.
da88d2e,I think they'll start winning some games once Dirk comes back from his injury. They could still wind up getting a good draft pick, but it probably will not be first overall.
da88d17,Yeah some of us are still thankful not to have Andris Biedrins as a starter
da88cyv,Idk but whether theyve been fans of the team or just became fans make absolutely no difference. Like, you prove someones a bandwagon right? Then what. What changes lol theyre still going to follow that team and nobodys gonna remember theyre a bandwagon. 
Everyone becomes a fan of something at some point. Let people enjoy things lol
da88cn6,Like many other announcers around the league. 
da88cbu,Either way he doesn't take more than two steps. One jab forward and a jump back 
da88bzv,in my league a guy took Randle, Clarkson, and Russell really early just to piss off our Lakers fan friend
da88bwk,So Patriots fans from '02 are still bandwagon fans! Fuck em
da88brp,"Grinder rests"
da88blr,Why should he have to change the lineup? It's the exact same lineup/rotation as the 1st quarter where the Wolves are the 3rd best scoring team in the league in terms of point differential. It's clearly a matter of effort/execution and not personnel.
da88be5,Yep that's why he's only doing home games.
da88b26,Against the bad boy Pistons and '86 Celtics with no help...
da88ax8,:(
da88aka,The point about 3-4 (and damn lucky it wasn't 1-6) is that it shows how much LeBron has benefitted from playing in the garbage Eastern Conference.
da88agb,Been waiting for this all season from Blake. Not disappointed.
da88a9t,Rookies need to earn playing time. Hes not there yet. 
da88a8r,99.9999% of NBA comparisons have more to do with race than actual playing style.
da889rr,Woow jump through those hoops
da889ez,  Tj didn't play bad, missing shots does not equal playing bad. They were good shots.
da889eu,Who do you have in front of him, out of curiosity?
da889ej,well, so can I, if we don't care about quality. 
da889bs,I'm assuming you're a Bucks fan.

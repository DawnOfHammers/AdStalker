c91nup8,Thats fucking cool!
c91dbkd,oh this is an xpost from r/nba, btw
c3ox2yq,Once teams started to figure it out they changed back to the familiar team. Scottie Pippen eventually becomes the Point Forward prototype and Jordan gets to move without the ball and be Michael Jordan as we know him. 

So that's how we know the story. 

What if Jordan didn't have Pippen and Grant but had Reggie Miller and somebody else? He could have been feeding Kukoc, Reggie, Paxon/Kerr, Maybe the Bulls get Barkley or Kemp? 

If Michael Jordan had gond to Portland he might have played point next to Clyde. 
da88ht7,McCann is above average catcher at this point in both hitting and defense. They gave up two high upside guys far from the bigs. Percentage wise guys like this bust out close to 75%. The Yankees save 20 million over two years which could allOw them to get under the cap this year save by them a 50% tax. Look for Harper and trout to both be yankees in the next 4 years 
da81b0q,Aroldis and his slider would disagree with you.

http://www.pitcherlist.com/blog/gifs-of-the-night/aroldis-chapmans-slider-the-nastiest-pitching-gifs-from-the-world-series

da7zhij,McCann is a serviceable catcher for 80 games or so and a lefty with decent power and good contact rate.  There was no doubt he was going to stay in the AL because he is a good enough hitter to DH and will be prone to injuries as an older catcher.  He has a sweet swing and good hitting instincts so I think he'll be around for another 5 years shifting to DH.  His biggest injury issue is atypical...it's been his eyes.  He has had chronic issues with blurred vision in his left eye. Oakley made him special glasses for his problem.  I would bet the Astros have vetted this risk and are satisfied.

Fun fact: I played against Brian McCann in Atlanta's East Cobb summer league.  His das was my hitting coach.  Great guy. I never hit better than I did coming off a winter of his instruction which I'm sure McCann benefited from immensely. His older brother played shortstop and was regarded as the more talented of the two, until Brian hit a growth spurt and went from 5'5" to 6'3".  They were both immensely talented and quickly reminded me that I was not.  His bro never made it to the bigs.
da7ytbp,The huge amount of variance in what you just said should be all the proof you need that RBIs are a garbage stat.   

He could get you 50 RBIs! And maybe, just maybe, 40 fucking more of them!
da7wuka,hahah this is hilarious love it
da7vxx1,I dunno, the Cubs are pretty phenomenal, but that Yankees team was just amazing. Posada, Jeter, Rodriquez, Jeter, Cano, Texiera, Cabrera, Swisher... not to mention the pitching at the time. A lot of those guys are gonna be hall of famers. Almost everyone at that team had over 80 RBI's. 
da7vc9u,Completely agree.. I live in Orange County and am an Angels fan and as well as Trout and done his first 5 years.  People seem to forget how good Albert Pujols was in his first five years. As those numbers state above, he it literally a 'Machine'.  Adding to that, Pujols doesn't even come close to playing a similar style of defense at the level Trout has.  Comparing Accolades in the first 5 years are extremely similar though.
da7uqag,Josh Red-dick 

Lmao 
da7tpsd,He's most definitely a DH at best now, but I mean the guy can still hit 20+ homeruns and get you 50-90 RBI's.
da7tcpo,Definitely miss seeing him in a Braves uniform
da7oy9t,Burying Trout on the AL MVP ballot was a mistake. Not explaining it only compounds the error for one BBWAA voter...
da7o8og,Former Braves catcher probably best suited for DH at this point.
da7mwdh,We got taken out behind the woodshed by Toronto. 
da7mvnk,Look.  I called the World Series 5 months ago.  But that wasn't so difficult.
da7mv3v,Well, it happened!  All the way to extra innings of Game 7.
da7mu6o,Well, see what happened?
da7mtpw,Did you?
da7k4nk,Not really.
da7je0l,Is he even all the good still?
da7j5ky,It's time for Nolan to get checked out for Alzheimer's.
da7gglj,They can also hide defensively challenged sluggers and aging stars with the DH role.
da7gdxq,But one big difference is staying with a starter longer in close games, and starters are the best pitchers on a team in most cases.
da76fz6,Riiiiiiiiiight
da761p9,Pujols was on steroids. Still is, probably. Guy was a 13th round pick and then within a calendar year was in the big leagues putting up Babe Ruth numbers.
da75x12,AL games take longer bc they have more offense bc there's a DH, and bc there are slightly more frequent pitching changes due to not having to deal with the pitcher's lineup spot. 

I'm not sure about the pitch style difference - I don't watch enough AL ball to compare, but it doesn't seem true to me, or to make much sense at all. Players switch between leagues constantly, there's no reason there'd be different pitching styles.
da89eg7,This is what the Pro Bowl should be. Flag football tournament of the best players from each division. Winning division wins an away game in London/Mexico/etc.
da89e87,I love how they do short seasons so the show remains fresh and always has new ideas 
da89e5x,It's like an AFC West curse. 
da89e26,Said by someone who likely rarely saw him play. Fletcher was quietly a beast. His game was consistency. He wasn't flashy, but he got the job done every damn time. Iron man at a position of first contact, he absolutely should get in the Hall in time. Not a 1st ballot but he was quietly one of the best at his position for more than a decade
da89dvx,We got Jon Ryan. He's from Regina.
da89du8,People act like going to the playoffs is all players care about, because it's what the fans want.
da89dtq,Fantasy football related posts should be posted in /r/fantasyfootball

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/nfl) if you have any questions or concerns.*
da89dtg,His release is definitely one of the slowest in the league. Especially when under pressure. I feel that if he has a clean pocket his release is quicker
da89ds5,http://m.imgur.com/r/Redskins/HqBcX

Someone made this a few years back. ...it's not to say that London Fletcher is better or maybe even as good as Ray Lewis. ....but IMO It's crazy that Lewis is considered one of the greatest of all time and Fletcher is considered to be just another decent player who had a long career. It's  
much closer than people think, especially considering Fletcher's durability 
da89dmp,I pray that he somehow gets a loose ball after a muffed punt or something and scoops and scores. It would be like Dez last week but 10,000x more unlikely. 
da89dj2,The tears of his football career ending a la Steve Young
da89dey,> Bubby Brister

THE GOAT

BUBBY BRISTER
da89dbx,I would hate to see that happen to somebody like Luke Kuechly.
da89d88,As soon as Tom Brady or BB retires, no matter how well the Patriots are doing, Gillette will struggle to fill their seats due to the fact that the stadium has priced out most of the hard-core working class fans, and fair weather fans don't really care about football 
da89d0k,This was a college game, but as time was running down in the first quarter two guys sitting next to me kept yelling for the home team to call time outs. 
da89cxz,Triggered
da89cxi,I think we have a full defense between the four of us we could field a good defense, our offense she would be incredible with Big Ben throwing to brown, green, eifert, bell, and take your pick between smith, Coleman or Pryor. That's all without even touching an o-line that would give any d-line fits.
da89cu3,Damn you're right!
da89csf,[Here](http://i.imgur.com/gfbrcoY.jpg) you can see an original newspaper issued after the game, back from 1934
da89cmj,Hahaha true that. Reason I pick Kalil is both hometeam bias, and I know what all he does for the offense. He is as important for our team as Cam and Luke. Goodness that center depth!
da89cmi,I lost a parent, and I wanted to get right back out and play with my baseball team immediately, because she loved baseball and it makes you feel normal at a really shitty time.
da89cmc,It's that old southern conservative cut. Not trying to get political but I have lots of friends from the south and a lot of them dress with much looser fits that in some cases look objectively bad. 
da89cf1,http://i.imgur.com/PlxbhyX.jpg
da89ceh,Unlike your entire QB roster for the last forever.
da89bko,I love people recognizing the importance of the rugby tackle in today's League. Should into the gut/hip, close arm under the thigh, far arm around the back, leverage your weight against the lifted leg; it no longer becomes skill-against-skill, strength-against-strength. It's just proper tackling technique.


Something that impressed me about Pete Carroll coming in was around the time when all these new rules were coming out about what is an illegal hit, most of our guys had to adjust. He basically laid out that it doesn't matter that it's a weak hit, it doesn't matter that it's not fair, it doesn't matter that this is a wussy play...

...it's the rules and if you don't want to play within the rules of the sport you don't get to play the sport. 
da89ehb,Maybe he's not an elite shutdown defender but his versatility outside is a major factor. Consider CP3 for example, who leads guards in DRPM right now; he's a great on-ball defender, but he exclusively guards point guards, and doesn't get matched against James Harden, Jimmy Butler, D Wade, DeRozan, etc.
da89dty,I'm not giving Barnes the star treatment until he earns it.  I did not find his performance notably bad.
da89dsa,Steve Nash. case closed
da89dlt,Lol he actually ended up on the 6ers in my myleague. All their big men play around 20 mpg and they've been to the finals 4 straight years
da89dkn,Dude was burning MKG. MKG played solid D too.

Happy for Jrue and the Pelicans
da89d27,Ball streams died
da89cu8,Should have been fired a year ago \#getmeoffthegusbus
da89ctk,All it takes is 1 injury to one of their 4 best players, and there goes your theory.
da89c66,Welcome to the Westbrook wild ride
da89bw3,Chad could have used stats to back up his claim too, only reason I said it to the warriors fan was because they brought up career stats and said they were lower so I assumed they looked into it. Believe it or not I responded to what they said based on what they said, not their flair 
da89bs8,It's so annoying that on Xbox I need to reload the game I want to watch 4 or 5 times before it actually starts streaming. Too bad their arent better options out there aside from Ball Streams
da89bjg,Can I still jump onto the bandwagon?
da89b2m,"Fifteen minutes later, I e-mailed the team and threatened to cancel my season tickets if they didnât trade Jonathan Huberdeau, Erik Gudbranson and a first-round-pick to Vancouver for Roberto Luongo.  Nobody responded, but it was worth a try."  
  
Just awesome.
da89b26,Pippen was a 6'1" walk-on in college. Then he had a growth spurt to 6'8".
da89b02,its a meme ya dingus 
da89aut,The only thing I have against him is that he didn't win much in the weakest era of Basketball until he got Magic Johnson in LA. I still do not understand how he only got one title
da89alv,Was that Aaron Rodgers on the Bill Simmons show outtakes that he posted on his podcast?
da89aib,No they don't. 
da89a6z,I'm thinking about Trading Al Horford in fantasy basketball. Need to move for a SG or a PG, any potential targets?
da899ts,He's gonna be a solid NBA player. He just drew a bad hand getting drafted to the Kings and them traded to a bad Sixers squad. 
da899pl,Yeah lol. He is almost always 2 or 3 on people's list 
da89990,He's usually 2nd or 3rd (him and Magic constantly swap) in most peoples lists....

d9uxhzj,I agree Hillary is horrible person and a corporatist and im also a Bernie supporter. I just thought there  might be a chance she would be steared to do some good and have a better temperament. Lets face it the Republican party is for the billionaires and corporations and most of the Democratic party is too. The free trade agreement was a bill started by the Republican party under Bush senior and signed in by Bill Clinton. So both are equally guilty for selling out the american people. My fear is Pence will be running the country like Dick did for Bush jr and having an GOP controlled house, senate and supreme court. We are in for a bigger crash than the last one. Twice in the last 100 years the GOP controlled all 3 branches of Government 1921-1929. What happened? 1929 The Great Depression! The second time 2003-2007 What happened? 2007 The great Recession! LIke Michael Moore said in trump land ( Trump will be the biggest FUCK YOU by the middle class and it will feel good untill he gets in office and reality sets in) There is a bubble about to pop because Obama did not do anything to change the deregulation of the banks. That caused the 2007 crash and the same shit is going on and it would have happened with Hillary in there too. I just hope its not magnafide  by a GOP controled government. Good luck to us all and I hope im wrong but what is done is done . Now we need to get behind Bernie and his movement and change both parties!

d72272u,happy mga widows at kumpare hehhe!!
d3ssy10,I suggest you post a comment to the original blog post so the author can respond. :)
da89env,Back when they said they were adopting the Rockstar model of game producing where they try to top themselves in every way with each new game I realized they would be getting my money for years to come. Witcher 3 is still one of my favorite games ever, and it was a huge improvement on the first to. They're a solid company.
da89ec0,I have PS+, but don't play multiplayer. Only got it so I could read/write notes in Bloodborne Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
da89e8p,It'll never happen for basic economics reasons. No pressure to clear physical space for new products with higher profit margins. No direct digital competitors. There will be sales but they'll never match the sales of physical copies because the market is different. 
da89dx6,They are already used, but thank you
da89doe,Same thing here. I didn't renew my ps+ sub. Because monthly games weren't that good and I play very little multilayer nowadays.

The game I bought this year were UC4 and metal gear solid 5.

Ho and battle field 4. But solo is crap.
da89dnz,I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes to be honest. The most boring shit I've ever played! 

The game might be good I have no idea but if you're an impatient gamer I think you'll struggle with the intro. 
da89dng,I guess it has to be me not washing my hands before playing. Figured it out. Thanks. 
da89d0v,Welcome :)
da89cxb,Thats the one I meant the hardest oneI beat it on brutal on remaster
da89c7y,I figure I'll pick up your mom while you're out at the sale.
da89btf,You also could've waited til you got your tv and saved $100 bucks
da89bmq,I've heard it's due to the marketing agreements they have with big box retailers largely prohibiting them from making digital the same price until it leaves physical retailers, or else big box retailers won't carry their games anymore. 
da89bk8,Legacy m8
da89b8s,Jesus, I'm hyped for it.
da89ane,Because retail value is largely determined by the physical space a product takes up rather than the product itself. Digital copies don't have newer more valuable items competing for physical space whereas a physical copy of BF1 might take up the space that could be used to sell new copies of Dishonored 2 (or whatever) at a much higher profit margin. Stores take the slight loss on profit to recoup or mitigate any losses and clear space for products that have higher profit margins. Digital sales don't have the same sort of pressure. 
da89ale,No physical copies. 
da89aek,It's never too late!!!  

Some advice - play through the story campaigns first and don't even worry about pvp (plenty of time for that later).  Also, don't worry about too many of the missions that focus on you needing a fireteam (like the raids).  Once you've played through all that you'll need to start building a fire team, and there's no better place to meet people than the100.io and /r/fireteams - the communities in BOTH those places are amazing.

Also, if you're on PS4, feel free to send me a PM.  Our clan would be happy to have you and show you the ropes.
da89aaf,That's the best one by far. The way the female VA says it is fantastic.
da89a2p,A button combo for quicksaving would be so nice. You don't risk accidentally quick saving when you don't have to and you don't risk quick loading either. Option and right on the dpad would be excellent and the x to confirm. Although a mission should really only allow x amount of times you can quick save to prevent chewing through the story.

da898l2,unfortunatelly not everyone can get physical copies
da8988v,It's basically Deus Ex mixed with the RPG aspect of CDPR. A futuristic roleplaying game sounds dope. 
da897w9,Game is very popular still. I came ino it last year after the TTK bundle and had a great time. I'd imagine the newest expansion rejuvenated the player base even more. 


da897ub,As a new ps4 owner interested in cross buy games with vita, how are there still rumored vita releases when Amazon doesn't even sell "new" vitas anymore? Did they stop production of them?

d7s1b3u,Check out this unboxing video of the iphone 7+ https://youtu.be/AoiNj-0wbvQ

d7pgdl7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN36vhpAPX0
IT's unboxing time OH YEAH!
d7ekzbj,No, $1000 for a personal computer. Compare how much you use your phone in a day (personally AT LEAST every waking hour I use it for some time). A movie these days is like $6 an hour, so within 166 hours of use, it's the same price as a movie; mind you the more I use it over that it gets cheaper than a movie. Just my 2 cents keeping things in perspective for power users.
d7eeaxn,I'm pretty sure buying directly from Apple is one way to get a contract free phone.

d2if8la,love my iphone, but they really need to keep the 3.5mm jack
d2biful,Rumored yes, there was a video recently where a case manufacturer sent a cover for anlysing and there was ni port to fit a 3.5 mm jack in it. Additonally, the case was of the exact same dimensions of a iphone 6s
d13c3cc,Why the iPhone 7 got iOS 6
czcd7gw,I like the concept. But I think apple isn't that far yet.
cz7decs,I do hope they do something with the back camera. I really dislike it and it spoils the look of otherwise a very beautiful device.
cycgaqp,I think wireless charging is not to a point where Apple will include it in their devices (i.e. it doesn't technically exist since you still have to plug the charger in and have the device in one specific spot while charging). 

iPhone 6s/6s+ can already film in 4k. It would be cool to see a 2k or 4k display that is edge to edge though with smaller upper and lower bezels.

The camera bump will always exist, I think, unless iPhones go thicker at some point or camera sensor and lens technology improves and they are able to be made even smaller.

I'd personally love to see a Space Black model that matches the Apple Watch as well as a 32gb base model. I'd also like to see speaker tech similar to iPad Pro, with multiple speakers and dynamic orientation.
cxtymqn,looking good

da87aq0,Water
da87916,Now.
da878kr,I travel a lot so I bought an Amazon brand iPhone retractable lightning cable. Best purchase ever .
da85dre,This post is awesome. I honestly thought you were kidding when I read it at first.
da85ctx,OK not scammed. Tricked? I don't know. I could've spent less money if they didn't have add on items and of they showed the postage beforehand.
da855wh,Just got it on Thursday can't believe that I didn't have it before
da852yy,That's not being scammed
da852a0,I shopped Amazon b/c it was almost always cheaper than anywhere else and I was willing to wait 2 days to save the money. 
They're not that much cheaper anymore, if at all, and Prime shipping almost never takes 2 days anymore. It's been taking 3-4, sometimes 5. Customer service is a joke now too. I doubt I'll renew as it's just as easy now to just drive the mile or two to Target, Walmart, Costco, Best Buy etc to get what I need.
da84zgm,Prime. 
da83ehy,I immediately contacted amazon CSR.....unfortunately they can't keep up with these scammers....I browsed an amazon forum and its highly discussed...
da838xz,> I don't suppose you would know if dubbed-material from Spain generally includes a Latin American dub as well (something that I greatly prefer). I doubt that's the case but there is always the chance.

I don't know, sorry. I'd guess nope.

> Would you happen know if any Latin American countries ship to the US?

The only other Amazon site in Latin America is Amazon Brazil, and they only sell books. There are probably some non-Amazon sites that ship to US, but I wouldn't know.

> I ask this because I lived in Latin America for over a year and used the Latin American netflix while there. While there, I watched a lot of dubbed things which I would like to continue watching them now that I'm back in the US. I was using a VPN for a while but netflix has now detected it and the internet at my new place isn't fast enough for that regardless.

Have you tried setting your [Netflix user interface language](https://www.netflix.com/LanguagePreferences) to Spanish? Netflix limits the available audio and subtitle tracks to those local to your location and those matching your language preference, even if they have more tracks.

I quickly checked Star Trek: Deep Space Nine  and I got a Spanish audio track that way - no idea if it is Latin American or not, though, and I'm outside US so that might not work for you for that specific show.

> I'm completely willing to buy them all legally. I just can't find them anywhere in the US.

If you give an example, I could take a quick look.
da82c8s,Makeup, clothes, or some nice new earphones!
da822z4,PokÃ©mon sun or moon
da80wcb,If you ask for the cancellation, it won't affect their cancellation rate.

If they cancel the order without you requesting it, it negatively affects their metrics. http://prntscr.com/d9irbn
da7ze2e,It usually becomes apparent when you are checking out. I'm not a big fan of Amazon's search function simply because it's terrible.
da7ymb2,Same thing is going on with my copy of PokÃ©mon Moon. They contacted the carrier, who knows if it'll actually arrive tomorrow. I was supposed to have it on the day of release. Only reason I ordered it online was because I got a great deal for being a Prime member but I'm disappointed that they couldn't get it to me on time.
da7xz17,Uhm dude, you can just buy it from the store now and then do a free return once you get the Amazon one in the mail... Not that hard.
da7xxfi,I think what he plans to do is get an English-speaking friend to go on Amazon with him on Black Friday and help him order the thing he wants.  

Sorry if this is an obvious question (I actually don't use Amazon very often) but will the seller list in their information if they ship international, especially to his country?
da7xvpt,I don't suppose you would know if dubbed-material from Spain generally includes a Latin American dub as well (something that I greatly prefer).  I doubt that's the case but there is always the chance.

Would you happen know if any Latin American countries ship to the US?  I ask this because I lived in Latin America for over a year and used the Latin American netflix while there.

da88cbk,You really need to add an "Old Fat Guy" division.  Not sure if I want to be in a group with crazy people doing 200k steps in 5 days.   lol
da881hx,This makes a lot of sense. Thanks! I get it now. 

I like this because it does make it more balanced. It's fun to see Michelle and William kill it with 200k steps a week, but I'm more in the 80k range.
da87uta,Just give her the Fitbit. She probably wanna join some Fitbit group challenges and stuff. My Wife and her Fitbit owner friends are crazy about outdoing each other's daily steps. 
da8557a,I've tried to draw a diagram (http://imgur.com/CTGaVh5), not sure if it's helpful. So essentially Div 1 is the top, 2, 3, and 4 are equal. 

3 people get relegated from 1, 1 person from 2, 3 and 4 get promoted. So, you'll be in 2 but think of it as a group of 27 people. 

Once everything's more balanced we might return to the old format. 
da83pvn,I've had two Fitbit Surges. The first one was a defect right when they first came out and Fitbit promptly replaced it. So, I've been wearing this one for basically two years without any problems. Maybe I got lucky. 

I have been skeptical on the HR monitor. However, it has always matched the HR on the equipment at the gym. I figure it's about as good as you can get without wearing a chest band.

Anyway...GPS works fine for me. Fairly quick to connect in the USA. Maybe it would be worth checking your sat constellation where you are. At the end of the day, it's a wrist GPS so accuracy is fairly low.
da83jaj,That's actually what lead me to this thread!
da7zi2y,When it says Relegation, where do we get relegation to? I know I'll get an invite, I just am not sure I'll know what division it will be from.

I'm surprised I was able to run with the big kids in Div 1 for so long. Whew, they  put on a crazy amount of miles! 

Thanks again /u/cautiousbiscuit! This is fun!
da7w729,I believe the issue is the build of the scales, where some contacts inside eventually break from the pressure due to wear? I think ill just get another one anyway :)
da7uytq,
Did you chat with someone online or call to get the 25% off code?
da7sw00,I see! Thanks.

I have high blood pressure, and put on weight the last 10 years. So that's the cause then... I had no idea.
da7qo3b,If you want always on... Pebble 2 or Garmin. Sorry :(
da7qjne,You can add it via both I believe. I know I switch between two iPhones and have my Charge listed on both (they are restores from the same backup, so I might be cheating there). Quite certain it will sync with both. Haven't tried having them both on and in proximity however, that could cause some weirdness.

I also have multiple Fitbit's associated with both (Charge HR 1 & 2) which I also swap around depending on what's charged and what I'm doing.
da7o73d,Isn't that more of a software issue? If there are no hardware issues or improvements that would cause an increase in sales then doubt it
da7lpwz,Almost 209,000! Crazy impressive 
da7l11h,I'm out of warranty and was offered 25% a couple of weeks ago. I didn't have to supply a photo or anything. Just said it ripped in half (which is true) and they said they can only offer me 25% off a new one. 
da7kvam,I had the band on my HR rip apart completely. Like the plastic underneath the rubber broke and snapped in half. I honestly went to the dollar store and bought a small tube of super glue. Just be reallly careful to not get it all over your fingers!! I would also suggest putting a little tiny piece of tape over the screen so if you do get glue on the screen you can take the tape off immediately and not have glue on the screen like I do.  It definitely doesn't look as great as it once did but from a far you would never know it was in two pieces last week. 
da7juoe,I can confirm this work, their customer service is A1, but the build quality not so much.
da7irtk,Damn. I was hoping it was just me. Literally the only reason I went back to the old dashboard. I guess I won't be updating the app anymore.

Thanks for your reply. :)
da7i2go,That is where I am truly lucky. I have a gym where I work. I go in an hour early so I can go run in the neighborhood around my office and use the gym showers. Some days I run about 5 miles and others I run 7. There are variables like how I am feeling, if my buddy is running with me, etc
da7h7s4,I sent you a friend request a while back :) - Andy 
da7gr71,Kickass work on the weight loss and running!
da7go30,How many did he have?
da7gnly,RHR: 66

Age: 25

Weight: 180lbs (dropped -17lbs so far since August, long may it continue)
da7gk0e,The new weight goal tile is frustrating -- I want to go back to seeing lbs left to reach the goal, not lbs dropped so far. Has anyone found a way to change this?
da7gj6g,Hey would you please put me in this week? Thank you!!

da89dcl,But what if OP complained to corporate? Their complaint would be just as valid. I don't necessarily recommend they do it unless SM does nothing about the problem but they have the power to complain as much as anyone else.
da894a2,Our tills actually start with less for some odd reason. If I've gotten a few twenties for tall pike (I hate this and I hate having to open the safe because I have no ones) I don't have much change in the drawer. And in our neighborhood, where one of our regulars was beaten and robbed and left for dead several nights ago and remains in ICU, fuck no I'm not opening the drop box or safe. I'm not trying to put myself or my partners at risk.

da87ex9,Because it's cold and their poor little fingers might get colder.  
EDIT: PRETEND THIS IS IN CAPS.
da87dqx,We do have one atm in my area that automatically gives out thw largest bills it can. Pain in the ass
da87af9,I work at a reserve/clover shop and it absolutely has a coffee shop vibe! I never thought about how it might be in a store without reserves or clovers. Our focus in or store is our reserve coffees and our clover. We are a drive thru as well.
da8791z,My script for when someone tries to pay with a $50 or $100:

"I'm sorry, do you have anything smaller?" Smile and stare them down. If they say no, immediately suggest, "What about a credit card?" Don't even hint that you could break it. The stare down usually does it, IMO. Don't try to explain or justify anything.

I 100% believe that we should not be opening the drop boxes for anyone. You are just asking to get held up.
da877ml,Could ask the barista to kick the kids without a drink out..

Nor is it really even the same thing when a barista gets overly flirty or personal with a customer. 
da86i0d,I know  someone with a service parrot. She's an emotional support animal to help with her agoraphobia. She focuses on the parrot when she has to leave her home. 
da868by,Have you tried subbing our regular espresso for holiday espresso? Makes our beverages that much more bearable
da85ntp,Tell your SS when this is happening, they can fix your till.
da89eth,I got the darker one and I think it's really pretty. I'm assuming that my 2011 mbp is the same as the current silver, and when I side-by-side it's no competition for me. But like you say, some people prefer the other so it's nice that they give a few options.
da89es6,Apple never does that intentionally.
da89eop,Total disaster. Hey Apple, that's not how you gonna boost sales in 2017.
da89el0,So u can have a reason to upgrade and keep the revenue at all time highs when they do bring 4k
da89dzk,You're asking how much someone makes at Apple but don't even understand the difference between a retail employee and a corporate employee?
da89dxk,Have both. Watch 0 and 2016 MacBook i5.  They are completely different use cases. I also have a 2014 15" MBPr, fully loaded. They all serve different uses. The big laptop is great for all day work sitting at a home office, with additional screen. Plus it has enough memory to do some high end lifting. The MacBook is the ultimate portable machine. And, I can get a full days worth of work done on it, though I still feel using the 15" I'm more efficient. I like the keyboard on the MacBook but have tested the new Pro 13 and think that has a better keyboard than the MacBook (gen 2 butterfly vs gen1). I don't like that there's only a single USB-c port on the MacBook -- for the times im sitting in long workshop meetings and have it plugged in, it would be nice to also plug in my phone and keep that charged. Old habits I guess. Get the watch if you live by your messaging and calendaring apps. It's fantastic for helping keep on top of "what's next". I get the sense you need screen size / workspace. There are third party open source apps you can use on all of the laptops to drive custom resolutions, and while this works fine on the 12" screen, my eyes get tired when I shrink the resolution too much and I default back to the 15" screen when I can.  I also have a dell Precision 15" laptop that is old and a workhorse. After using all of those I'd recommend look closely at a 13" Pro. And get the watch regardless. 
da89dt3,I solved the problem! Well, on *my* phone, at least.

I reset the network settings (Settings-->General--> Reset-->Reset Network Settings). Worked like a charm.
da89d9q,That's the joke.
da89cff,>  Android AOSP 

Oh? Link please. Pretty sure you have no idea what you're talking about.
da89cee,Wait and see in the next 10 years. I want my own personal Jarvis to do stuff for me
da89c4d,Yeah I hate the gold too. And I'm thinking of changing the color of the phone to space grey but space grey and sliver are like the most bought colors everywhere even if the space grey makes that 1mm black border around the screen almost unseeable. And I have to say I'm afraid that I'm gonna notice that border too often.
da89c3t,I'm talking about these types of portable, tablet sized ones like this. 
da89bz6,
>The first two get between 8 and 9 hours for the Lenovo ThinkPad P50 (with a 4K display and either 8 or 16 GB of RAM <- dual channel in this case). 

Wrong!

>ThinkScopes[1]

da89bua,"Siri, call my mom"

"OK, so you'd like to call *insert my own fucking name here*".

HOW the FUCK did siri start fucking this up?
da89asc,I feel like the full width button is a placeholder for them to add another button beside it.
da89ac4,I love the mental gymnastics you're doing in order to justify the poor decisions done by Apple.

The iPhone 7 is not compatible with the new MacBook Pro unless you buy a new cable or adapter. It's a pure money grab. If Apple let you swap them for free, there would be no problem.

So Apple says TB3/USB C is the future, yet none of their other devices support it out of the box.

The regular MacBook had 1 USB C port for over a year now, and we're still releasing iPhones and iPads with USB A cables?
da899yj,Not ironic
da899kj,Start around 7:40:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F7N254MTA4Q
da899fz,retail = working in stores selling phones and computers

corporate = working at Apple HQ doing any variety of things from HR to Engineering
da899b8,Ah, sounds like building a shoddy screen without enough underfill could be a planned tactic to get more people to pay for Apple Care over time.
da89996,Going to disagree, 4k is a great resolution at 27" if you're a resolution whore like me (have the Dell P2715Q).

Only real complaint is that you need a real workhorse of a GPU to run games at 4k, but I use mine mostly for photo editing.
da8995k,This issue has occurred on freshly replaced iPhones, so how exactly is that the users' fault? 
da8994m,That's called being an apologist. It's an attention seeking behavior. Arguing with them or mentioning them reinforces the behavior.

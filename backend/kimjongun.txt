c3ox2yq,Once teams started to figure it out they changed back to the familiar team. Scottie Pippen eventually becomes the Point Forward prototype and Jordan gets to move without the ball and be Michael Jordan as we know him. 

So that's how we know the story. 

What if Jordan didn't have Pippen and Grant but had Reggie Miller and somebody else? He could have been feeding Kukoc, Reggie, Paxon/Kerr, Maybe the Bulls get Barkley or Kemp? 

If Michael Jordan had gond to Portland he might have played point next to Clyde. 
da88ht7,McCann is above average catcher at this point in both hitting and defense. They gave up two high upside guys far from the bigs. Percentage wise guys like this bust out close to 75%. The Yankees save 20 million over two years which could allOw them to get under the cap this year save by them a 50% tax. Look for Harper and trout to both be yankees in the next 4 years 
da81b0q,Aroldis and his slider would disagree with you.

http://www.pitcherlist.com/blog/gifs-of-the-night/aroldis-chapmans-slider-the-nastiest-pitching-gifs-from-the-world-series

da7zhij,McCann is a serviceable catcher for 80 games or so and a lefty with decent power and good contact rate.  There was no doubt he was going to stay in the AL because he is a good enough hitter to DH and will be prone to injuries as an older catcher.  He has a sweet swing and good hitting instincts so I think he'll be around for another 5 years shifting to DH.  His biggest injury issue is atypical...it's been his eyes.  He has had chronic issues with blurred vision in his left eye. Oakley made him special glasses for his problem.  I would bet the Astros have vetted this risk and are satisfied.

Fun fact: I played against Brian McCann in Atlanta's East Cobb summer league.  His das was my hitting coach.  Great guy. I never hit better than I did coming off a winter of his instruction which I'm sure McCann benefited from immensely. His older brother played shortstop and was regarded as the more talented of the two, until Brian hit a growth spurt and went from 5'5" to 6'3".  They were both immensely talented and quickly reminded me that I was not.  His bro never made it to the bigs.
da7ytbp,The huge amount of variance in what you just said should be all the proof you need that RBIs are a garbage stat.   

He could get you 50 RBIs! And maybe, just maybe, 40 fucking more of them!
da7wuka,hahah this is hilarious love it
da7vxx1,I dunno, the Cubs are pretty phenomenal, but that Yankees team was just amazing. Posada, Jeter, Rodriquez, Jeter, Cano, Texiera, Cabrera, Swisher... not to mention the pitching at the time. A lot of those guys are gonna be hall of famers. Almost everyone at that team had over 80 RBI's. 
da7vc9u,Completely agree.. I live in Orange County and am an Angels fan and as well as Trout and done his first 5 years.  People seem to forget how good Albert Pujols was in his first five years. As those numbers state above, he it literally a 'Machine'.  Adding to that, Pujols doesn't even come close to playing a similar style of defense at the level Trout has.  Comparing Accolades in the first 5 years are extremely similar though.
da7uqag,Josh Red-dick 

Lmao 
da7tpsd,He's most definitely a DH at best now, but I mean the guy can still hit 20+ homeruns and get you 50-90 RBI's.
da7tcpo,Definitely miss seeing him in a Braves uniform
da7oy9t,Burying Trout on the AL MVP ballot was a mistake. Not explaining it only compounds the error for one BBWAA voter...
da7o8og,Former Braves catcher probably best suited for DH at this point.
da7mwdh,We got taken out behind the woodshed by Toronto. 
da7mvnk,Look.  I called the World Series 5 months ago.  But that wasn't so difficult.
da7mv3v,Well, it happened!  All the way to extra innings of Game 7.
da7mu6o,Well, see what happened?
da7mtpw,Did you?
da7k4nk,Not really.
da7je0l,Is he even all the good still?
da7j5ky,It's time for Nolan to get checked out for Alzheimer's.
da7gglj,They can also hide defensively challenged sluggers and aging stars with the DH role.
da7gdxq,But one big difference is staying with a starter longer in close games, and starters are the best pitchers on a team in most cases.
da76fz6,Riiiiiiiiiight
da761p9,Pujols was on steroids. Still is, probably. Guy was a 13th round pick and then within a calendar year was in the big leagues putting up Babe Ruth numbers.
da75x12,AL games take longer bc they have more offense bc there's a DH, and bc there are slightly more frequent pitching changes due to not having to deal with the pitcher's lineup spot. 

I'm not sure about the pitch style difference - I don't watch enough AL ball to compare, but it doesn't seem true to me, or to make much sense at all. Players switch between leagues constantly, there's no reason there'd be different pitching styles.
da89eg7,This is what the Pro Bowl should be. Flag football tournament of the best players from each division. Winning division wins an away game in London/Mexico/etc.
da89e87,I love how they do short seasons so the show remains fresh and always has new ideas 
da89e5x,It's like an AFC West curse. 
da89e26,Said by someone who likely rarely saw him play. Fletcher was quietly a beast. His game was consistency. He wasn't flashy, but he got the job done every damn time. Iron man at a position of first contact, he absolutely should get in the Hall in time. Not a 1st ballot but he was quietly one of the best at his position for more than a decade
da89dvx,We got Jon Ryan. He's from Regina.
da89du8,People act like going to the playoffs is all players care about, because it's what the fans want.
da89dtq,Fantasy football related posts should be posted in /r/fantasyfootball

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/nfl) if you have any questions or concerns.*
da89dtg,His release is definitely one of the slowest in the league. Especially when under pressure. I feel that if he has a clean pocket his release is quicker
da89ds5,http://m.imgur.com/r/Redskins/HqBcX

Someone made this a few years back. ...it's not to say that London Fletcher is better or maybe even as good as Ray Lewis. ....but IMO It's crazy that Lewis is considered one of the greatest of all time and Fletcher is considered to be just another decent player who had a long career. It's  
much closer than people think, especially considering Fletcher's durability 
da89dmp,I pray that he somehow gets a loose ball after a muffed punt or something and scoops and scores. It would be like Dez last week but 10,000x more unlikely.

da89d0k,This was a college game, but as time was running down in the first quarter two guys sitting next to me kept yelling for the home team to call time outs. 
da89cxz,Triggered
da89cxi,I think we have a full defense between the four of us we could field a good defense, our offense she would be incredible with Big Ben throwing to brown, green, eifert, bell, and take your pick between smith, Coleman or Pryor. That's all without even touching an o-line that would give any d-line fits.
da89cu3,Damn you're right!
da89csf,[Here](http://i.imgur.com/gfbrcoY.jpg) you can see an original newspaper issued after the game, back from 1934
da89cmj,Hahaha true that. Reason I pick Kalil is both hometeam bias, and I know what all he does for the offense. He is as important for our team as Cam and Luke. Goodness that center depth!
da89cmi,I lost a parent, and I wanted to get right back out and play with my baseball team immediately, because she loved baseball and it makes you feel normal at a really shitty time.
da89cmc,It's that old southern conservative cut. Not trying to get political but I have lots of friends from the south and a lot of them dress with much looser fits that in some cases look objectively bad. 
da89cf1,http://i.imgur.com/PlxbhyX.jpg
da89ceh,Unlike your entire QB roster for the last forever.
da89bko,I love people recognizing the importance of the rugby tackle in today's League. Should into the gut/hip, close arm under the thigh, far arm around the back, leverage your weight against the lifted leg; it no longer becomes skill-against-skill, strength-against-strength. It's just proper tackling technique.


Something that impressed me about Pete Carroll coming in was around the time when all these new rules were coming out about what is an illegal hit, most of our guys had to adjust. He basically laid out that it doesn't matter that it's a weak hit, it doesn't matter that it's not fair, it doesn't matter that this is a wussy play...

...it's the rules and if you don't want to play within the rules of the sport you don't get to play the sport. 
da89ehb,Maybe he's not an elite shutdown defender but his versatility outside is a major factor. Consider CP3 for example, who leads guards in DRPM right now; he's a great on-ball defender, but he exclusively guards point guards, and doesn't get matched against James Harden, Jimmy Butler, D Wade, DeRozan, etc.
da89dty,I'm not giving Barnes the star treatment until he earns it.  I did not find his performance notably bad.
da89dsa,Steve Nash. case closed
da89dlt,Lol he actually ended up on the 6ers in my myleague. All their big men play around 20 mpg and they've been to the finals 4 straight years

da89c66,Welcome to the Westbrook wild ride
da89bw3,Chad could have used stats to back up his claim too, only reason I said it to the warriors fan was because they brought up career stats and said they were lower so I assumed they looked into it. Believe it or not I responded to what they said based on what they said, not their flair 
da89bs8,It's so annoying that on Xbox I need to reload the game I want to watch 4 or 5 times before it actually starts streaming. Too bad their arent better options out there aside from Ball Streams
da89bjg,Can I still jump onto the bandwagon?
da89b2m,"Fifteen minutes later, I e-mailed the team and threatened to cancel my season tickets if they didnâ€™t trade Jonathan Huberdeau, Erik Gudbranson and a first-round-pick to Vancouver for Roberto Luongo.  Nobody responded, but it was worth a try."  
  
Just awesome.
da89b26,Pippen was a 6'1" walk-on in college. Then he had a growth spurt to 6'8".
da89b02,its a meme ya dingus 
da89aut,The only thing I have against him is that he didn't win much in the weakest era of Basketball until he got Magic Johnson in LA. I still do not understand how he only got one title
da89alv,Was that Aaron Rodgers on the Bill Simmons show outtakes that he posted on his podcast?
da89aib,No they don't. 
da89a6z,I'm thinking about Trading Al Horford in fantasy basketball. Need to move for a SG or a PG, any potential targets?
da899ts,He's gonna be a solid NBA player. He just drew a bad hand getting drafted to the Kings and them traded to a bad Sixers squad. 
da899pl,Yeah lol. He is almost always 2 or 3 on people's list 
da89990,He's usually 2nd or 3rd (him and Magic constantly swap) in most peoples lists....

d9uxhzj,I agree Hillary is horrible person and a corporatist and im also a Bernie supporter. I just thought there  might be a chance she would be steared to do some good and have a better temperament. Lets face it the Republican party is for the billionaires and corporations and most of the Democratic party is too. The free trade agreement was a bill started by the Republican party under Bush senior and signed in by Bill Clinton. So both are equally guilty for selling out the american people. My fear is Pence will be running the country like Dick did for Bush jr and having an GOP controlled house, senate and supreme court. We are in for a bigger crash than the last one. Twice in the last 100 years the GOP controlled all 3 branches of Government 1921-1929. What happened? 1929 The Great Depression! The second time 2003-2007 What happened? 2007 The great Recession! LIke Michael Moore said in trump land ( Trump will be the biggest FUCK YOU by the middle class and it will feel good untill he gets in office and reality sets in) There is a bubble about to pop because Obama did not do anything to change the deregulation of the banks. That caused the 2007 crash and the same shit is going on and it would have happened with Hillary in there too. I just hope its not magnafide  by a GOP controled government. Good luck to us all and I hope im wrong but what is done is done . Now we need to get behind Bernie and his movement and change both parties!

d9sk06u,##**Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. Iâ€™m so distressed right now I donâ€™t know what to do. I didnâ€™t mean to do that to my mom but Iâ€™m literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like Iâ€™m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This canâ€™t be happening. Iâ€™m having a fucking breakdown. I donâ€™t want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want hillary to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasnâ€™t supposed to be like this, I thought she was polling well in New York???? This is so fucked.**
